# Github rules

**Github repos, names, merge requests (MR), reviews, homeworks**

- *SHOULD* be one repo for all homeworks 
- repo name *SHOULD* be named like `lastname-name(?:-otus)?.*`, `^(?:\w)+-(?:\w)+(?:-otus)?.*$`, f.e. `korzhikov-alex-otus`
- main branch *SHOULD* be `master`
- repo *SHOULD* exclude node_modules, editor files, bower_components, etc.

- each homework *SHOULD* be inside the folder named as a block (`javascript`, `node`, etc)
- each homework *SHOULD* be a separate `MR` (helps reviewing, adding comments) from the feature branch (branched from `master` or any other working branch) with a block name and a lesson number (javascript-1, node-3, react-4, angular-3) to `master`
- if any changes were requested, updates *SHOULD* be done inside the existing branch and `MR`
- each `MR` *SHOULD* be merged to `master` after the homework is accepted 
(if a project contains many steps/homeworks - valid changes *SHOULD* be seen in the next `MR`)
(it is possible to make the other branch a target for `MR` to show actual changes)
- every scaffolding code *SHOULD NOT* be included into `MR`
- keys, passwords *SHOULD NOT* be included into `MR`

- test & build *SHOULD* pass
- *MAY* work with `git` from command line, not using `github` web interface
